# Pill and Capsule Analyser

"Pill Capsule Identifier" is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to identify pills in an image based on color. Users can upload an image containing multiple pills, click on one pill, and the program will highlight all other pills in the image that share the same color by drawing rectangles around them.
